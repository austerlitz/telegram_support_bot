# TelegramSupportBot

## Introduction

`TelegramSupportBot` is a Ruby gem designed to enhance customer support through Telegram, allowing
for the management of queries directly from a designated chat while ensuring privacy and
confidentiality.

## Features

- Forward messages between users and a support chat
- Supports various message types (text, images, videos, documents, audio, stickers)
- Auto-away messages for off-hours
- Simple configuration and deployment

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'telegram-support-bot'
```

## Usage

### Creating and Configuring Your Bot

1. **Create Your Bot** via BotFather on Telegram to get your bot token.
2. **Deploy Your Application** and set up a controller action for webhook callbacks, directing them
   to `TelegramSupportBot.process_update`.
3. **Set the Webhook URL** using the Telegram Bot API to your controller action.

### Setting Up Your Telegram Bot

1. **Add Your Bot to a Support Chat** and obtain the `support_chat_id` by sending the `/start`
   command to the bot inside the support chat.
2. **Configure Your Bot** in your Ruby application with the token and `support_chat_id`, and set a
   welcome message.

```ruby
TelegramSupportBot.configure do |config|
  config.adapter         = :telegram_bot
  config.adapter_options = { token: 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN' }
  config.support_chat_id = 'YOUR_SUPPORT_CHAT_ID'
  config.welcome_message = 'Hi! How can we help you?'
end
```

3. **Interact with Users**: Messages to your bot will be forwarded to the support chat, and replies
   in the chat will be sent back to the users.

## Adapters

`TelegramSupportBot` supports integration through adapters. Currently, `telegram-bot`
and `telegram-bot-ruby` are supported.

Configuration is pretty much the same for both gems:

```ruby
TelegramSupportBot.configure do |config|
  config.adapter         = :telegram_bot
  config.adapter_options = { token: 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN' }
end
```

```ruby
TelegramSupportBot.configure do |config|
  config.adapter         = :telegram_bot_ruby
  config.adapter_options = { token: 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN' }
end
```

## Examples

**Basically, just make sure you call `TelegramSupportBot.process_update` somewhere in you workflow
cycle and pass it a parsed json update received from Telegram servers.**

### Using `telegram-bot` Gem with a Webhook Controller

If you're using the `telegram-bot` gem, set up a Rails controller to handle incoming webhook
requests. Here's an example of how you might implement such a controller:

```ruby

class TelegramWebhooksController < ApplicationController

  def webhook
    update = JSON.parse(request.body.read)
    TelegramSupportBot.process_update(update)
    head :ok
  end
end
```

Make sure to configure your routes to direct webhook callbacks to this controller action.

### Using `telegram-bot-ruby` Gem with bot.listen

For those utilizing telegram-bot-ruby, you can set up a simple listener loop to process incoming
messages. This approach is more suited for polling rather than webhooks:
require 'telegram/bot'

```ruby
token = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'

Telegram::Bot::Client.run(token) do |bot|
  bot.listen do |message|
    TelegramSupportBot.process_update(update.to_h)
  end
end
```

## Custom Adapter Implementation

Implement custom adapters by inheriting from `TelegramSupportBot::Adapter::Base` and defining
message sending and forwarding methods.

## Handling User Privacy Settings for Message Forwarding

Due to Telegram's privacy settings, users may have restricted the ability for bots to forward their messages with identifiable information. This restriction impacts the `forward_from` key, necessary for the bot to recognize and reply to users directly. To ensure seamless communication and support, we recommend including instructions in your bot's welcome message, asking users to allow message forwarding from your bot. Here's an example of how you can phrase this request:
```
Please mind, that your privacy settings might prevent the bot from sending you the reply from the support team. Please consider adding this bot to your allow-list for forwarding. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
  
1. Go to Settings in your Telegram app.
2. Tap on 'Privacy and Security'.
3. Scroll to 'Forwarded Messages'.
4. Add this bot to the list of exceptions by selecting 'Always Allow' for it.

This will allow the bot to send you back replies from the support team.

```

Including such instructions can help in reducing the friction in user support interactions and ensure that your support team can effectively communicate with users through the bot.
